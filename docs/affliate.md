# Affliate Marketing

Did you know you don't need to know how to design wordpress or develop to earn?

Yes, that's right âœ…

### What is affliate Marketing

This is advertising on behalf of others and earning commisions.

Imagine this, me as TechWithTwin I offer WordPress designer services, I also offer commisions on my service e.g. 10% so whatever you sell on my behalf you earn automatically, Imagine getting 1,000 clients?ğŸ¤” Do that for 100 businesses?ğŸ¤‘ğŸ¤‘

Affliates for plugins e.g [JETPACK](https://jetpack.com/affiliates/). If they offer a commision of like 10% or 5% and then you write a blog about it and 1000 clients purchase using your link imagine how much you can earn.

Another way is to create content online like reels and use your affliate link and then your will still earn.

Finally you do this for alot of products and then you will earn when sleepingğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ¤‘ğŸ¤‘ğŸ¤‘
